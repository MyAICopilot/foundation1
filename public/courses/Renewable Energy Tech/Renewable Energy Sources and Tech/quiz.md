Answers/Explanations:

c) Energy sources naturally replenished over time.
Explanation: Renewable energy refers to energy sources that are naturally replenished and can be used without depleting their finite resources.

c) It helps combat climate change and promote sustainable development.
Explanation: Renewable energy plays a crucial role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, combating climate change, and promoting sustainable development.

b) By converting sunlight into electricity using photovoltaic cells.
Explanation: Solar energy is generated by converting sunlight into electricity using photovoltaic (PV) cells or through concentrating solar power (CSP) systems.

c) It reduces reliance on fossil fuels and creates job opportunities.
Explanation: Wind energy reduces reliance on fossil fuels, improves air quality, and creates job opportunities in the clean energy sector.

c) By harnessing the energy of flowing or falling water.
Explanation: Hydropower generates electricity by harnessing the energy of flowing or falling water through turbines connected to generators.

c) It is a reliable and continuous source of renewable energy.
Explanation: Geothermal energy is a reliable and continuous source of renewable energy, producing minimal greenhouse gas emissions and requiring a small land footprint.

d) Energy obtained from organic materials like plants or animal waste.
Explanation: Biomass energy refers to the use of organic materials, such as plants or animal waste, to generate heat, electricity, or biofuels.

b) It improves system reliability and flexibility.
Explanation: Energy storage technologies store excess energy generated from renewable sources and release it when needed, improving system reliability and flexibility.

c) Policies and incentives that encourage the adoption of renewable energy.
Explanation: Renewable energy policies and incentives are measures implemented by governments to encourage the adoption of renewable energy, such as feed-in tariffs or tax credits.

c) Lower greenhouse gas emissions and reduced pollution.
Explanation: Renewable energy sources have lower greenhouse gas emissions, reduce air and water pollution, and minimize ecological impacts compared to fossil fuels.
