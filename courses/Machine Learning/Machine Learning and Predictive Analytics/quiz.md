**Answers:**

1. c) Making predictions or decisions without explicit programming.
   Explanation: Machine learning involves developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming.

2. a) Supervised learning.
   Explanation: Supervised learning uses labeled data, where the inputs and corresponding outputs are known, to train the model.

3. a) Linear Regression.
   Explanation: Linear regression is used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more input features.

4. d) F1 Score.
   Explanation: The F1 score is a balanced measure that combines precision and recall, providing a single metric for model evaluation.

5. d) Ensuring features are on a similar scale.
   Explanation: Feature scaling is used to scale features to ensure they are on a similar scale, preventing some features from dominating others during model training.

6. a) Oversampling.
   Explanation: Oversampling involves generating synthetic samples of the minority class to balance the dataset, such as through techniques like SMOTE.

7. a) Model selection.
   Explanation: Model selection involves choosing the most appropriate algorithm for a given problem based on factors such as dataset size, complexity, interpretability, and performance requirements.

8. d) Observations recorded at different time intervals.
   Explanation: Time series data represents observations recorded at different time intervals, enabling analysis and prediction of future values based on historical patterns.

9. b) Fraud detection.
   Explanation: Fraud detection involves predicting fraudulent transactions by analyzing patterns and anomalies in historical data.

10. b) Bias and fairness.
    Explanation: Bias and fairness in machine learning involve addressing bias in data and models to ensure fairness and avoid discrimination against certain groups.
