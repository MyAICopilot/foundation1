A GREAT PRODUCT

**1. The Secret to Success**

- A great product is the key to success for all great companies.
- Tricks and shortcuts won't work in the long run.
- Startups must prioritize building a product users love.

**2. Long-Term Growth**

- A great product is the only way to achieve sustainable long-term growth.
- Growth hacks will eventually stop working.
- Successful technology companies focus on building a product people want to use.

**3. Product Improvement Engine**

- Build a "product improvement engine" in your company.
- Talk to users, observe their product usage, and identify areas for improvement.
- Continuously iterate and enhance your product to compound its value.

**4. The Importance of the Cycle**

- The faster the repeat rate of the product improvement cycle, the better the company's outcome.
- During the early stages, founders should primarily focus on building the product and engaging with users.
- Prioritize this cycle over other activities, ensuring constant product enhancement.

**5. Getting Close to Users**

- To execute the cycle effectively, founders must get close to their users.
- Observe users directly, even sitting in their offices if possible.
- Value both user feedback and user behavior to understand their needs and motivations.

**6. Doing Things That Don't Scale**

- Recruit initial users individually, even through manual and personal approaches.
- Fulfill user requests and build features based on their feedback.
- Prioritize user satisfaction and make the product so good that users become advocates.

**7. Iterative and Adaptive Approach**

- Break the product development into small pieces and iterate as you progress.
- Avoid planning too far ahead and launching a single large release.
- Start with a simple version and launch it sooner than expected, embracing simplicity throughout.

**8. Key Questions for Startup Evaluation**

- Ask critical questions to assess the product's effectiveness:
- Are users engaging with the product repeatedly?
- Do users show a high level of enthusiasm and loyalty?
- Would users be genuinely disappointed if the company ceased to exist?
- Are users recommending the product to others without prompting?
- For B2B companies, do they have at least 10 paying customers?

**9. Making the Product Better**

- Many growth issues stem from an insufficient product.
- Address the underlying problem by improving the product's quality.
- Most excuses for poor growth often lead back to the product not being good enough.

**10. The Power of User Feedback**

- When unsure about the next steps or facing product challenges, talk to users.
- User feedback is valuable in resolving disagreements within the company.
- Care about product quality, including all user interactions with the company (support, sales, etc.).

**11. The Ultimate Savior**

- Remember, without a great product, nothing else can save a startup.
- Focus on building a product users love as the foundation for success.
