A Great Team

**1. A Great Team**

- Mediocre teams do not build great companies.
- Strength of the founders and hired employees is crucial.
- Important founder characteristics: unstoppability, determination, formidability, resourcefulness, intelligence, and passion.
- Traits like rigidity and flexibility are desirable, with strong beliefs in the company's core mission and openness to learning.
- Responsiveness is a key indicator of decisiveness, focus, intensity, and getting things done.

**2. Communication and Founder Skills**

- Communication is a vital skill for founders.
- Founders who are hard to talk to are usually not effective.
- Tech startups need founders with product-building capabilities and sales/customer interaction skills.
- Evaluating potential co-founders should be based on existing relationships and sufficient data.
- Cofounder breakups are a leading cause of early startup failure, so choosing the right co-founder is crucial.

**3. Cofounders and Equity**

- Having a good cofounder is the best-case scenario.
- Being a solo founder is the next best option.
- Having a bad cofounder is the worst-case scenario.
- If things are not working out, parting ways quickly is advised.
- Equity split discussions should be addressed early on to prevent complications.
- Nearly equal equity split is generally recommended, with a slight preference for one extra share to avoid deadlocks during disagreements.
