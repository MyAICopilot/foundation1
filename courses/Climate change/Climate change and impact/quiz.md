**Answers:**

1. a) Burning fossil fuels - Burning fossil fuels is a major contributor to increased greenhouse gas emissions. Fossil fuel combustion releases carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, amplifying the greenhouse effect.

2. c) Carbon dioxide - Deforestation reduces the Earth's capacity to absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) and contributes to increased greenhouse gas emissions. Forests act as carbon sinks, absorbing CO2 through photosynthesis.

3. a) Greenhouse effect - The process by which certain gases trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere is called the greenhouse effect. This phenomenon leads to a warmer climate by preventing some of the heat from escaping into space.

4. c) Reduction of species variety and abundance - Biodiversity loss refers to the reduction of species variety and abundance in ecosystems. Climate change disrupts ecosystems, leading to species extinction and a decrease in biodiversity.

5. d) Reduced pollination and agricultural productivity - Disrupted ecosystem services due to climate change can result in reduced pollination and agricultural productivity. These services are essential for crop production and food security.

6. c) Increased absorption of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere - Ocean acidification is caused by the increased absorption of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere by seawater. This process lowers the pH of seawater and has detrimental effects on marine life.

7. c) Heat exhaustion and heatstroke - Rising temperatures and heatwaves contribute to heat-related illnesses, such as heat exhaustion and heatstroke. Vulnerable populations are at a higher risk, including the elderly, children, and individuals with pre-existing health conditions.

8. c) Extreme weather events - Climate change affects agricultural productivity and water availability primarily through extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods. These events can damage crops, reduce yields, and disrupt water supplies.

9. b) Improve air quality - Transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources helps to improve air quality. Renewable energy generation produces minimal air pollutants compared to fossil fuel combustion.

10. a) Limit global temperature rise and adapt to climate change - The Paris Agreement is an international treaty aiming to limit global temperature rise and adapt to climate change. Its objectives include greenhouse gas emissions reduction, financial support for developing countries, and international cooperation in addressing climate change.
